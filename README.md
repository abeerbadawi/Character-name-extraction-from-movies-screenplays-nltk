# Character-name-extraction-from-movies-screenplays-nltk

In this code, we develop an algorithm to read the screenplays and automatically extract the character names from the screenplay as follow:
1- We propose a solution to create training data

1. We design two algorithm and compare between them.

2. We propose an evaluation metric and evaluate the result of your algorithm with the proposed metric.

The repository includes:
1) The code 

2) a sample of the results

3) quantitative analysis (numerical evaluation)
